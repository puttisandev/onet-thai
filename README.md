# Roadmap: Creating Unlabeled Thai Subject Dataset for Grade-12 Learning and LLM Testing

Overview

This project aims to create a roadmap for developing a specialized dataset focusing on Thai subjects for Grade 12 students. The dataset will be utilized to train large language models (LLMs) and test their performance in answering exam-style questions. To achieve this, we extract and refine exam questions from the publicly available Thai Exam dataset on Hugging Face, concentrating solely on Thai-language subjects.
